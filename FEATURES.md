## Cancelled / Out of Scope

| Feature           | Reason                                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Snapshot rollback | Not aligned with project goals; too destructive for a lightweight UI |
| File browser      | Scope creep; out of charter for a storage management tool            |
