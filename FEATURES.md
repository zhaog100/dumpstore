## Planned

| Feature                  | Priority | Notes                                                                            |
|--------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenTelemetry            | Low      | Full OTEL instrumentation: traces (HTTP, Ansible runner, ZFS execs), metrics (bridge existing Prometheus counters), logs (slog → OTEL exporter). Deferred until a collector (Jaeger, Grafana Tempo/Loki/Mimir) is available. |
| ZFS native encryption    | Low      | Load/unload keys, encryption status per dataset, keyformat/keylocation support. **Deferred until auth/TLS layer exists** — passphrase over plaintext HTTP is too risky. |
| Dataset rename           | Medium   | Rename a dataset or volume in place                                              |
| Snapshot clone           | Medium   | Create a new dataset from an existing snapshot                                   |
| Pool create/import/export| High     | Create pools (mirror, raidz1/2/3, draid) from available block devices; import importable pools; export pools safely |
| Snapshot diff            | Medium   | Show files changed between two snapshots (`zfs diff`)                            |
| Per-user quota tracking  | Medium   | Space usage per user/group (`zfs userspace` / `zfs groupspace`)                  |
| ZFS send/receive         | Low      | Pool replication and off-site backup                                             |
| Dataset rewrite          | Medium   | Rewrite existing file blocks to apply updated dataset properties (compression, checksum, dedup, copies) to already-stored data via `zfs rewrite`; options for recursive, skip-snapshot-shared blocks (`-S`), skip-clone-shared blocks (`-C`) |
| Alerts                   | Low      | Configurable thresholds for pool health, disk temp, capacity                     |

## Cancelled / Out of Scope

| Feature           | Reason                                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Snapshot rollback | Not aligned with project goals; too destructive for a lightweight UI |
| File browser      | Scope creep; out of charter for a storage management tool            |
