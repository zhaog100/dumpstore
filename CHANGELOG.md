# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [v0.0.9] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- **NFS share management** — per-dataset NFS sharing via the ZFS `sharenfs` property; NFS button on each filesystem dataset row opens a dialog showing the current share options, with Share and Disable actions; button highlights with accent colour when sharing is active, tooltip shows the current options string
- `sharenfs` property readable via `GET /api/dataset-props/{name}` and writable via `PATCH /api/datasets/{name}`; backed by `zfs_dataset_set.yml`
- `publishDatasets()` — dataset list is pushed to all SSE subscribers immediately after any property change, so the NFS button state updates in real time across all open tabs
- `ShareNFS` field on the `Dataset` struct; `sharenfs` column included in `ListDatasets` so SSE carries NFS state without an extra round-trip
- **Installed Software** — "NFS server" row added to the Sysinfo tab; probes `exportfs` on Linux and `mountd` on FreeBSD
- **Requirements** — NFS server packages (`nfs-kernel-server` / `nfs-utils`) documented in README requirements table and install snippets

## [v0.0.8] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Enhanced Prometheus metrics** — `GET /metrics` now exposes HTTP request counters (`http_requests_total{method,path,status}`) and latency histograms (`http_request_duration_seconds{method,path}`), plus Ansible playbook counters (`ansible_runs_total{playbook,status}`) and duration histograms (`ansible_run_duration_seconds{playbook}`); paths are normalised to keep cardinality low; static file requests are excluded
- **Install script** — `install.sh` builds and installs the binary, playbooks, and static files, and registers the service on both Linux (systemd) and FreeBSD (rc.d); also supports `--uninstall`
- **BSD 2-Clause License**

## [v0.0.7] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Software inventory** — `/api/sysinfo` now probes and returns versions of all external tools used at runtime: ZFS, Ansible, Python, smartctl, nfs4-acl-tools, setfacl, and the system package manager; missing tools are reported as N/A
- **Installed Software section** — dedicated table on the Sysinfo tab, displayed directly below the Host info card
- **Dataset mountpoint ownership management** — `GET/POST /api/chown/{dataset}` shows and sets the owner/group of a dataset's mountpoint via Ansible; chown button added to the dataset row

### Changed
- Sysinfo tab layout overhauled: Host card now has a section header; Storage Pools and I/O Statistics rendered side-by-side in a 50/50 grid, each filling its half
- Dumpstore version moved from the ZFS version bar into the sticky header badge
- Pool device names wrap instead of truncating with ellipsis
- I/O Statistics table stretches to fill its column; redundant section label removed

### Fixed
- Duplicate `v` prefix in the header version badge (version string already contains the prefix from the build tag)
- Missing `btn-chown` CSS style that caused the chown button to be invisible
- `syslog` priority prefixes now emitted correctly so journald maps log levels to the right `PRIORITY` field

## [v0.0.6] — 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **SSE initial state** — new subscribers now receive the current state immediately on connect instead of waiting for the next data-change poll cycle; the broker caches the last published payload per topic and delivers it synchronously in `Subscribe()`, under the same mutex as the subscriber-list update to prevent a race with concurrent `Publish()` calls
- **SSE connection stability** — a 30-second keepalive comment (`: keepalive`) is sent on idle streams so proxies and NAT devices do not drop connections to topics where data rarely changes (e.g. `user.query`, `group.query`)

## [v0.0.5] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **POSIX ACL management** — view, add, and remove POSIX ACL entries on mounted datasets via `GET/POST/DELETE /api/acl/{dataset}`; uses `getfacl` / `setfacl`
- **NFSv4 ACL management** — same API, uses `nfs4_getfacl` / `nfs4_setfacl`; `acl` and `nfs4-acl-tools` are optional runtime dependencies
- `acltype` property editable via `PATCH /api/datasets/{name}` (`off`, `posix`, `nfsv4`)
- ACL tab in dataset row: shows current entries, add-entry form, enable/disable controls
- "Disable ACLs" button in ACL dialog (uses `<dialog>` pattern, not `confirm()`)
- Mandatory POSIX base entries (`user::`, `group::`, `other::`) shown without a delete button to prevent invalid ACL state

### Fixed
- **systemd mount namespace** — removed `PrivateTmp=true` and `ProtectSystem=strict/full` from the service unit; both options create an isolated mount namespace with slave propagation, causing `zfs create` to not auto-mount and `zfs destroy` to see datasets as busy
- `zfs destroy` now uses `-f` (force unmount) to reliably remove mounted datasets when invoked from the service
- Ansible task failure messages now include `stderr`/`stdout` in addition to the generic `msg` field, making ZFS errors visible in logs and the op-log dialog

### Changed
- All Ansible task names capitalised to satisfy `ansible-lint` name-casing rule

## [v0.0.4] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Local user management** — list, create, edit, and delete local Unix users via `GET/POST /api/users` and `DELETE /api/users/{name}`
- **Local group management** — list, create, edit, and delete local Unix groups via `GET/POST /api/groups` and `DELETE /api/groups/{name}`
- Users & Groups tab in the UI with system-account rows shown muted (no delete button)
- Type-to-confirm delete dialogs for users and groups
- Ansible playbooks: `user_create.yml`, `user_delete.yml`, `group_create.yml`, `group_delete.yml`
- `internal/system/system.go` — parses `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/login.defs` for user/group reads
- SSE topics `user.query` and `group.query` pushed on write ops and every 10 s on change

### Changed
- `/etc` write operations (useradd/userdel/groupadd/groupdel) protected by a mutex to avoid concurrent modification
- System accounts (UID/GID < `UID_MIN`) are protected from deletion at both API and playbook level (403)
- `nobody` / `nogroup` explicitly guarded against deletion regardless of UID/GID
- README updated with Users & Groups API, SSE topics table, and planned features table

## [v0.0.3] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Replace placeholder text logo with SVG lockup in the UI header
- Add SVG favicon (`dumpstore-blue-dark-icon48.svg`)
- Update README to use dark/light-mode-aware SVG logos via `<picture>`
- Add `images/` directory with full set of logo variants (blue/mono, dark/light, icon48/icon80/lockup)

## [v0.0.2] — 2026-02-xx

### Added
- **Live updates via SSE** — Server-Sent Events endpoint (`GET /api/events`) pushes pool, dataset, snapshot, and I/O changes every 10 s; browser falls back to 30 s REST polling if the connection is lost
- Subscription broker (`internal/broker`) with per-topic pub/sub and change detection (JSON equality check)
- Background ZFS poller goroutine that publishes only on data change
- Dark/light mode logo variants in README
- Screenshots in README

## [v0.0.1] — 2026-01-xx

### Added
- Initial release
- Go HTTP server (stdlib only, no external dependencies)
- **System info** — hostname, OS, kernel, CPU, uptime, load averages, process stats
- **Pool overview** — health badges, usage bars, fragmentation, deduplication ratio, vdev tree
- **I/O statistics** — live read/write IOPS and bandwidth per pool
- **Disk health** — S.M.A.R.T. data per drive via `smartctl`
- **Dataset browser** — collapsible tree, compression, quota, mountpoint
- **Dataset management** — create, edit properties, and delete (with confirm-by-typing dialog) filesystems and volumes
- **Snapshot management** — list, create (recursive), and delete snapshots
- Ansible playbook runner for write operations with structured JSON output
- Prometheus metrics endpoint (`GET /metrics`)
- systemd unit file (Linux) and rc.d script (FreeBSD)
- `make install` with OS-aware service registration
